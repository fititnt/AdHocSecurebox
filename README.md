# TailsOS-for-non-whistleblowers
Rocha's playground for TailsOS (https://tails.boum.org/). Not really useful for others, it's just me playing around a OS.

```bash
# From an already running TailsOS with persistence enabled, run:
cd /home/amnesia/Persistent
git clone https://github.com/fititnt/TailsOS-for-non-whistleblowers.git
cd /home/amnesia/Persistent/TailsOS-for-non-whistleblowers
```
