**The files on this folder are meant to be read, not executed.**

The markdown files (.md) render nice on online sites that host git (GitHub is
one of the popular ones), but any text editor could allow read them.

The POSIX shell scripts (.sh), while likely to almost ready to copy and
paste on your terminal, are also mean to be read, so you could review for
your specific case.

There is no specific suggested order of reading. You can actually just take
what you want and use for your needs or create derivate work.
