# TailsOS for non whistleblowers: password manangement

## KeePassXC
- **Site**: <https://keepassxc.org>
- **GitHub**: <https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxc>
- **Default on TailsOS**: **YES**
- **Platforms**: Linux, Windows, macOS (database is compatible with apps for
  Android/iPhone)

KeePassXC, since already is installed on TailsOS, can be used without need of
setup a super user password or even unlock your Persistent storage.

Since KeePassXC is cross-platform, you can use the even the same software on
Linux, Windows and Mac.

What about mobile (Android, iPhone)? You can use any software that can
manipulate KeePass-style databases

### KeePassXC browser integrations
See <https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search/?q=keepass>. Rocha did not
recomend anyone of these in special.

## Other vault software instead of KeePassXC
KeePassXC already is decent. If you do not have any strong opinion, keep some
KeePass-style variant.
