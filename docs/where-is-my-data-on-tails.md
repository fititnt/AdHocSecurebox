## Too Long; Didin`t Read

- Tails is the *The Amnesic Incognito Live System*. This means that by default
  it will _save_ (aka "Persist") on reboot if you do not enable Persistence.
  - And even if you enable persistence, it will not necessary save everyting
    except if you explicitly choose to.
  - And even if you have enabled persistence, on next reboot you can choose
    to not unlock your drive and just use software that already is installed
    by default
- The Persistent partition created by Tails will be encrypted.
