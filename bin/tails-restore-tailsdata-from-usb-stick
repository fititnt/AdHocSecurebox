#         USAGE:  If this script already was added on the path (e.g. ~/bin), run:
#                     tails-restore-tailsdata-from-usb-stick
#                 Note: this script will ask for sudo powers on some parts, but
#                 do not execute with sudo script.sh. This is intentional.

#   DESCRIPTION:  tails-restore-tailsdata-from-usb-stick Restore (rescue) Tails Data
#                 with rsync strategy from an external USB stick already opened at
#                 the path
#                     /media/amnesia/TailsData/
#                 To the current he current running tails, e.g. the path
#                     /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/
#                 Both tails-backup-tailsdata-to-usb-stick. and tails-restore-tailsdata-from-usb-stick
#                 consider the concept that only one USB stick are considered
#                 the primary/source of data, and the backup is an replica.
#                 This is controlled with the empty file '.tailsdata-is-source'
#                 This script initially based on the official Tails wiki at
#                 https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/rescue/index.en.html
#
#       OPTIONS:  ---
#  REQUIREMENTS:  1. The current TailsData_unlocked should not contain the file .tailsdata-is-source:
#                        /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/Persistent/.tailsdata-is-source

# TODO: the portable-data.sh shoud be tested at least once (fititnt, 2020-10-21 21:36 UTC) 

#### [ALTERNATIVE] One-liner script ____________________________________________
# The portable-data.sh was based on the documentation at 
# https://tails.boum.org/doc/first_steps/persistence/rescue/index.en.html.
# If you really sure, you can execute this line:
#     rsync -PaSHAXv --del /media/amnesia/TailsData/ /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked
#
# What this script do is, since is already shipped with this project, do some
# safety checks (like require that the current file does not exist)
#     /live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/Persistent/.tailsdata-is-source
# This file was created by tails-backup-tailsdata-to-usb-stick. when doing a push
# backup to an external drive and we assume that if this exist on current system
# you may be using this script wrong.

##### Safety checks ____________________________________________________________
# These safety checks warn the user if the USB stick is not unlocked and if
# do exist some error with .tailsdata-is-source.
# Only one USB stick can have the file .tailsdata-is-source (used to know
# if an storage was marked as source of data and implicitly assume the other
# are replicas; no .tailsdata-is-replica is created)
# Note that portable-data.sh
