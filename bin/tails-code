#
#         USAGE:  tails-code
#
#   DESCRIPTION:  tails-code is an somewhat equivalent to `code` on Linux/Mac,
#                 but focused on running on Tails. This script assumes
#                 VSCode portable was installed based on the
#                 docs/docs/vscode-portable-setup.sh
#
#       OPTIONS:  ---
#  REQUIREMENTS:  ---
#          BUGS:  1. tails-code (at least alone) will not persist VSCode
#                    customizations. You would need to copy/rsync back
#                    from Desktop to Persistance the data/ folder
#                 2. tails-code still not setup some way to proxy VSCode
#                    connections via tor SOCKS5 proxy at 127.0.0.1:9050
#                    and --proxy-server=127.0.0.1:9050 options seems to
#                    not be sufficient
